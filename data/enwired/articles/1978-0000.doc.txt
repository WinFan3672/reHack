GREETINGS FROM ENWIRED
1978-01-01 :: 1978-0000
BY: John Goodard, CEO
************************************************
Hello, readers. You may have seen this magazine on a rack in your local
computer store and wondered, "What is EnWired?". Here goes. EnWired is a
computer magazine that talks about new stuff in computing. We believe that the
next 10, 20, or 30 years of computing history are going to be very exciting
indeed, and we intend to archive as much of it as possible, and educate the
reader about new and exciting technologies as they are announced and released.
We also want to talk about failures in technology, as those are just as
important as successes.

However, we don't just want to publish articles. You can send us a letter, and
we may write a response in the next issue (which comes out next year) if it's
good:

    EnWired
    222 Glove Ave.
    New York, NY.

So, get reading, get writing, and get excited!

John Goodard, 

Founder/CEO of EnWired.

PS: Since this is a computer magazine, here's a factoid. I typed this entire
magazine with TeX, a brand-new typesetting system by Donald Knuth that gives
positively beautiful results.
