Dear Reader,

If you are reading this, you were still subscribed to EnWired Magazine until
2008-01-01, when our last issue was published.

We missed the March issue, because of the restructuring making us busy, and
our last online article was on 2007-12-31. 

I imagine you'll've seen the "Goodbye EnWired" online article (since it
replaced all the old ones), as well as the follow-up on enwired.com.

In the follow-up, I was quite vague over what I was going to do, citing
'retirement'. Well, I have some ideas for a last hurrah, and you're joining
in.

On 2009-01-01, I will send a (small) Final Issue of EnWired Magazine, which
will primarily be a big response to letters. Publishing will be funded out of
my own pocket, and it will cost me ~$250,000 to do it. I don't care, and I
want to do it, to make things right. If you have a letter you want to send me,
do so here:

EnWired Letters 
PO BOX 1978 
Burbank, California

Talk about EnWired, technology, the past, whatever you want, and perhaps we
can all get together and have one last celebration. Also, if you send in a
list of websites you think are cool, I will compile the most popular ones at
the end. 

Oh, and if you could send $10 with your letter to cover the costs of your
issue, my day would be made. It's totally optional, of course.

Signed,

Elliot Marksman

PS: I've clipped the OFFICIAL article list to the back, saving you some time
and money if you want to get it.
