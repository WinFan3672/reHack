It's time for the once-in-a-decade recap of the last ten years. In our January 1990 issue, we went over all the innovation we thought was notable from the years 1980 to 1989.
This time, we're covering 1990 to 1999, where technology kept on progressing at an amazingly rapid pace, with great new OS, software, and hardware releases really shaking things up.

Here goes:

- NanoSoft Workspaces 3.0 (1990) was the first successful release of Workspaces, because it was prettier and easier to use.
- The age of the Gommodore 64 was out, and Amiga was in. Sadly, the high cost and competition meant it never sold well.
- The Macintosh II was a real shake-up for Macintosh fans.
- PGP and Linux were two notable open-source projects that became highly successful due to their superiority.
- A lot of form factor experiments (Gommodore CDTV, etc.) occured.
- The Creative Labs SoundBlaster series (particularly the 16) were highly innovative and popular sound cards.
- DOS really did die, with 6.22 being the last release of NS-DOS, the most popular version.
- The World Wide Web launched, and has been massively successful, with loads of companies capitalising on the growing communities of Internet users 'surfing the net'.
- id Software revolutionised PC gaming with Wolfenstein 3D and DOOM.
- The MP3 audio format provided an excellent size/quality compromise, and is widely used to this day.
- PlayStation was a big deal, with millions of units sold across the world.
- IBM Deep Blue beat world Chess champion Gary Kasparov in a milestone for machine learning that will be remembered forever.
- The Year 2000 Problem (Y2K) came and went, with far less disruption than expected.

We hope that by the time 2010 rolls around, more and more innovation keeps coming, and we hope to document all of it here at EnWired.
