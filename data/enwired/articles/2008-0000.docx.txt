EnWired Direct: We Are Officially Bankrupt (Chapter 11)

************************************************
The sad news we've been predicting since 2003 has come. The end of the line.
The final nail in the coffin. The finishing blow. EnWired is now bankrupt. Our
last profitable quarter was Q2 2001, which had a 1% profit margin. Since then,
we've been hemorrhaged money, staff, and subscribers, and it's finally over.

Now, to be fair, we're not dead *yet*. Chapter 11 Bankruptcy Protection isn't
game over. It means that the company needs to restructure in order to try and
be profitable again. If this were a Chapter 7 bankruptcy, we'd cease
operations, sell off assets to pay off debts, and maybe get bought up by a
bigger company for our remaining assets.

Chapter 11 is different. The company is controlled by a "debtor in possession",
which leads to one of three scenarios:

* Chapter 7 Bankrupy; Restructuring (which is what we are doing); Dismissal.

Our reorganisation plan needs to be approved by a judge, and it's basically our
last hurrah. The fact that you're reading this proves that our reorganisation
plan (which includes writing this article) has been approved (perhaps with some
minor changes), so who knows.

The whole bankruptcy business has gotten in the way of us wanting to talk about
Workplace 2007, or Workspaces Vista, or all the exciting Linux stuff, or any of
that. Our diminishing subscriber base (down from over a million in 2000 to
50,000 now) has made the business unsustainable, and we're out of money.

You know, it's ironic that John Goodard, our founder, passed away just one year
before our 2003 article titled "News Stories Dry Up And We're Losing
Subscribers". Perhaps it's a good thing, in a strangely twisted and poetic
fashion, that John never saw the decline, as I had to witness it. That being
said, I miss my old boss and long-time best friend like it was just yesterday
that he breathed his last breath with me sitting beside him. 

I know that this has been all negative, but it's a sign of the times. It really
is. The digital revolution has brought with it a lot of good, but it also
killed our very own business, despite us reporting on it so diligently.

To my readers, I am sorry for not trying enough. I am sorry that I did not work
hard enough to modernise our company, and I am sorry that I let it end up like
this. There may be hope, however. As discussed, we're working to restructure
the company, and we may succeed at bouncing back.

Signed,

Elliot

PS: Apologies for the lack of news this issue, you'll have to contend with
letters. Again, bankruptcy.
