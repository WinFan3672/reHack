FAQ

Q: Why no binaries?
A: Server costs would be too high. Just get to a paid service instead.

Q: Why only Big-8?
A: Because 95% of Usenet traffic (not counting bin.*) goes there, and
the rest are badly syndicated across Usenet. We want to make it so that
your posts made here are broadcast far and wide, and Big-8 is best for
that.

Q: Who runs ES?
A: Eternal September Services, a 501(c)(3) non-profit in the USA.
