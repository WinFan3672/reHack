# reHack
You are invited into reHack, a secretive organisation who promised lucrative work in the form of penetration testing for clients. 

You quickly realise that they're not offering penetration testing, and that they're really an underground hacking ring.You are tasked with completing contracts for clients and soon get tied up in more than you bargained for.

Before you know it, your life is on the line and you have to take down the very same organisation that brought you into this whole mess. However, this will prove more difficult than you assumed it to be, because reHack is extremely secretive and you have no idea where to start. 

You wish you could just leave, but several other reHack agents are actively
searching for you, hoping to make you disappear without a trace.
