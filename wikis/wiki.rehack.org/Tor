Tor is a haven for 100% legal activity. As such, it is important to be familiar with it.

1 Installing Tor
div()
To install Tor, purchase it on the reHackOS store.
div()
1.1 Using Tor
div()
To connect to an onionsite, run "tor <onionsite>".
div()
2 First Sites
div()
* The official tor site: tor.onion
    * Just to test your connection.
* reHack's official Tor Node: rehack.onion
    * This is just a honeypot; our actual onion service is private.
* W3D onion site: w3d.onion
    * The w3d maintains a directory of onionsites for your viewing 'pleasure'; it's mostly corporate sites that have tor mirrors.

3 Email
div()
Receiving email from Tor can be tricky; most email services automatically rejcect Tor emails, including mail.com and JMail. Yes, even mail.com with its terrible security blocks tor traffic, and the industry follows mail.com, so you need a tor mail client and service.

3.1 Client
div()
There's only really one game in town; `tormail`. It's free in the reHackOS store and it just works. 
When you get a login and password, run:
$ tormail login <email address> <password>
div()
3.2 Email accounts
div()
There are several offerings, some public, some private.
div()
3.2.1 Public services
div()
* Euclid (www.euclid.onion)
    * Owned by AnonMail.
    * Free.
    * Secure.
* MailTor (www.mail-tor.onion)
    * Paid (150 Cr. per account)
    * Owners unknown; suspected to be owned by mail.com, which suggests bad security.
    * Has a clearnet proxy: mail.tor
    * Do not use.
div()
3.2.2 Private services
div()
* reHack OnionMail (om.rehack.org)
    * Most agents can get invited with relative ease.
        * This includes beginner-level agents!
* 5mail
    * Maintained by 5chan itself for use by its anons.
    * Almost impossible to access without a 5chan membership.
