Tor is a haven for 100% legal activity. As such, it is important to be familiar with it.

1 Installing Tor
div()
To install Tor, purchase it on the reHackOS store.

1.1 Using Tor
div()
To connect to an onionsite, run "tor <onionsite>".
div()
2 First Sites
div()
* The official tor site: tor.onion
    * Just to test your connection.
* reHack's official Tor Node: rehack.onion
    * This is just a honeypot; our actual onion service is private.
* W3D onion site: w3d.onion
    * The w3d maintains a directory of onionsites for your viewing 'pleasure'; it's mostly corporate sites that have tor mirrors.

3 Email
div()
Because Tor works on a separate network than the clearnet, you can only send emails within Tor to other Tor mail servers. It is possible to use basic bridge software to move between the clearnet and Tor, but this is strongly discouraged due to security issues, and most mail servers drop such emails anyway, so it's not worth it. The point is, you need a Tor email address.

3.1 Client
div()
There's only really one game in town; `tormail`. It's free in the reHackOS store and it just works. 
When you get a login and password, run:
$ tormail login <email address> <password>
div()
3.2 Email accounts
div()
There are several offerings, some public, some private.
div()
3.2.1 Public services
div()
* Euclid (www.euclid.onion)
    * Owned by AnonMail.
    * Free.
    * Secure.
* MailTor (www.mail-tor.onion)
    * Paid (150 Cr. per account)
    * Owners unknown; suspected to be owned by mail.com, which suggests bad security.
    * Has a clearnet proxy: mail.tor
    * Do not use.
div()
3.2.2 Private services
div()
* reHack OnionMail (om.rehack.org)
    * Most agents can get invited with relative ease.
        * This includes beginner-level agents!

    * Maintained by 5chan itself for use by its anons.
    * Almost impossible to access without a 5chan membership.
