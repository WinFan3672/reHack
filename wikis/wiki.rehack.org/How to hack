How to hack
div()
Hacking is simple. If you're unsure, there are 2 methods to hack a server that this article discusses; exploiting ports and logging in with a known password.

Method 1: Ports

The first step in this method is to work out what to exploit. This is done using the nmap command. It lists all exploitable ports as well as how many need opening. 
If the amount of openable ports is less than the number needed for an exploit, this method does not work.

The second step is to open the relevant ports. Some ports cannot be opened, but some can. For a reference on what programs open what ports, see the following article:
Opening Ports

Once all the ports are opened, the fun part begins. All you need to do is run porthack on the node. This will take a bit of time, but once it's done, you can connect as an admin.

Method 2: Logging In

Logging in is a little bit more involved, but if you can do it, it always works.
First, you need to grab the admin password. Once you do, you run 'login <node IP> <password>' and you can connect as an admin.
Admin passwords are usually shared in emails or left as logged in accounts in xOS devices.

Conclusion

Hacking can be complex, but the two methods are the underlying methods that you use for almost everything. Most companies underestimate the weaknesses in their security:
* Web servers are often a weak, low priority point, but they can link to other, more important areas that are otherwise hidden.
* Message boards are often left unsecured.
* Companies almost never use firewalls.
* Companies almost never detect break-ins, despite the logs LITERALLY saying it right there and then.
* Companies rely on people, and the human elelemt is ALWAYS the weakest link in the chain. Doesn't matter if you use a random password, if Joe sends it over an email, we're still getting in.
