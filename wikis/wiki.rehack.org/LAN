LAN nodes are nodes that provide you access inside of a Local Area Network, which contains nodes that are only accessible within the LAN. These are made accessible because the Internet router needs to be connected to the Internet for devices on the LAN to access the Internet.
LAN nodes are common in both home and business networks, and are essentially a self-contained Internet. Unfortunately, Internet routers are incredibly insecure and can be broken into easily.
