LAN nodes are nodes that provide you access inside of a Local Area Network, which contains nodes that are only accessible within the LAN. These are made accessible because the Internet router needs to be connected to the Internet for devices on the LAN to access the Internet.
LAN nodes are common in both home and business networks, and are essentially a self-contained Internet. Unfortunately, Internet routers are incredibly insecure and can be broken into easily.

Navigation

When you connect to the LAN, you can now begin connecting to the nodes on it. However, each node has a either private IP address (in the format 192.168.x.x) or a vhost (a sort of web domain that references a device on the LAN, like `git`). 
This can make navigation almost impossible, but you are saved by the router. The router is located at 192.168.0.0 and you can just connect to it. Because you've already hacked into it (after all, that's what you're connecting through), it will just list all connections on the LAN.
