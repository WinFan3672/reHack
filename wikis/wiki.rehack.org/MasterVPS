MasterVPS is an interesting service. It allows you to spin up a 'bucket', which is essentially a server 'in the cloud' (a dumb buzzword for a datacenter). 
This has a useful purpose in hacking, as it allows you to spin up test nodes with real configs made for you, which you can hack as a test of skill.

Accessing

Their website (mastervps.me) shows all you need to know; their outdated price list, their overpriced nodes (we could easily outcompete them and make them go bankrupt with a competing service; we do run a LOT of services that aren't associated with our name as a cover for our activities), their poor security and design choices (XWebDesign?), and more.

Purchasing Nodes
div()
To purchase a node, connect to mastervps.service and select the "New Bucket" option. From there, you can spin up a basic server or a "secure" offering, and (bizarrely enough) an xPhone. How they managed that without getting sued amazes me to this day. Buckets are easy enough to spin up; you set an admin password and you're given an IP address to connect to.

Domain.Expert Integration
div()
Yes, MasterVPS integrates perfectly with domain.expert, allowing you to purchase a bucket on MasterVPS and give it a domain with Domain.Expert; a professional and easy package. At least DE offers reasonable prices for domains, in a business notorious for selling 'premium' domains at insane markups.

Security
div()
From what we tested, there's nothing to see. MasterVPS's central server has no admin console, and it's bottled tight. Makes me suspicious.

Overall

It's a fine service. Like, it works. What more do you need?
