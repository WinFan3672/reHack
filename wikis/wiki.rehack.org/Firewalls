Firewalls are programs that actively monitor ports on a node. If a firewall is enabled, opening exposed ports becomes much more challenging.
Thankfully, firewalls are almost always trivially easy to bypass.

1. Getting the right software

Breaking firewalls requires specialised software. The 'firewall' program is available from the Store and allows you to fully take down a firewall in almost all cases.

2. Finding the firewall solution

To disable a firewall, you need to ask it to shut down. Firewalls need authentication in the form of a solution. There are 2 ways to get this solution: cracking it and finding it lying around somewhere.
If some idiot has left the solution right there for you, usually by sending the solution to a coworker or friend, your work has been done for you. In the case of complex firewalls, this is usually your only option.

However, you can also crack the firewall. If you run 'firewall crack <IP address>', you can usually crack the solution in a matter of seconds.

3. Disabling the firewall

Once you have the firewall solution, if you run 'firewall solve <IP address> <solution>', the firewall gets disabled and you are free to break open as many ports as you wish.
