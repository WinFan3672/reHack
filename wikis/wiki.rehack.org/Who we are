reHack is an agency focusing on agent recruitment and freelancing.
That is, that's our front. The media hasn't caught onto our real motives and goals, with one notable exception (ColonSlash, which is suspected to be maintained by a reHack agent who went rogue.)

Our real goal is to make blackhat hacking accessible to as many people as possible, provided they pass our harrowing interview (which I am sure you, an agent, are familiar with.)
We provide missions that pay real money, and link people who want something done with someone who can do it for minimal fees (just 0.5% of the pay).

We provide infrastructure to allow this to happen, including an IRC server, this wiki, and an onboarding mission series to get you started.
We are the best thing that has ever happened to hacking. Ever.

We are reHack. And you are part of it. Welcome to the team.
