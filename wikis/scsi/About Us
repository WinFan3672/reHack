We are SCSI. SCSI is an invite-only group of hackers all working towards a greater good. A good analogy of who we are is comparing us to That.CD. That.CD is invite-only, yes, but also quite high-profile in the community, and a good gateway service for more, better services. In this case, we are That.CD. We are small compared to reHack, sure, but that's by design. reHack is full of amateurs who never did anything significant.
