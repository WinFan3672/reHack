The infamous reHack organisation has recently attacked 5chan, leaving large amounts of damage.
Just 3 days ago, the org attacked 5chan, an equally infamous hacker forum, deleting its clearnet address from the w3d registry (citing 'legal reasons') and copying its SQL database, which is currently for sale. 
What will come of this? Will anyone buy that SQL database? Will it fall into the hands of the agencies that glow oh-so-brighly? Only time will tell.
