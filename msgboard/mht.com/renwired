Recently, the domain re.enwired.com was created. The owner of the domain, Jacob
Marksman, Elliot Marksman's son, started sending emails to journalists
(including myself), telling of the rebirth of EnWired. This interested me, so I
waited about ten minutes before writing this article. Yes, MHT is becoming a
parody of itself at this point. No, I don't care. Is this a true rebirth of
EnWired just one month after its sudden and unexpected death? Or is it a tacky
way for Jacob to get some publicity off his father's name? I think the jury's
still out on this one; I'll let you decide.
