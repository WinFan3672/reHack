This is a quick Public Service Announcement: MHT is launching a forum! You can
discuss MHT's news articles as well as general things about technology (this is
technological journalism, after all). Do sign up and do make some posts, so
that we can foster a community around technology. That is my final goal in
life, to change the way we think about the technology we increasingly place in
our homes and (sometimes) bodies.
