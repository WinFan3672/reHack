IsDed Corporation announced today that the Mountain View recipe has been stolen
by an unknown third party, claiming that they suspect an employee may have
helped with the theft. At the same time, Coca Corporation has announced a major
refresh of their Citrus Blast drink, leading to suspicion that the company had
acquired the stolen recipe.

The recipe has also started widely circulating amongst hacker communities, with
the mainstream media focusing on the fact that the drink has significant
amounts of added flourine. Flourine is typically used in toothpaste (and, in
some places, water treatment), and while fine in small amounts, it can cause
damage to teeth and is highly poisonous. Fun fact, that is the reason why you
only brush your teeth twice a day!

In an act of defiance, I've decided to upload the Mountain View recipe to my
own FTP server (ftp.mht.com), so that you can view it for yourself. Do note
that the redactions are part of the recipe as it circulated. You're welcome. 

PS: If anyone from the mainstream media is reading this, please license this
story from me. I was the first to cover it, and MHT is my livelihood.
