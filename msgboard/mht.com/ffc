You probably recall the earlier hack into IsDedCo that uncovered the secret
recipe for Mountain View, which has led to widespread shock and concerns over
corruption, mismanagement, and profit over people. Well, guess what? The exact
thing has happened to FFC, the popular multinational fast food chain most
famous for its chicken that contains 69 different herbs and spices. An
anonymous individual has just sent me a copy of the official Complete Herb and
Spice List, which has been sought after for years. The individual (whose
identity remains unknown) has this to say:

    It was stored on a publicly available FTP server, and was almost entirely
    unsecured. We were able to get in with a simple exploit. Even a script
    kiddie [a hacker who uses existing tools instead of performing 'real'
    hacking] could have done it. In fact, we're surprised it hasn't already
    happened. It was a stupendously bad decision to trust an unsecured FTP
    server with trade secrets.

A spokesperson for FFC has this to say:

    Thank you for alerting us of this. Our investors will be interested to hear
    this. However, it should be noted that our herbs and spice list isn't
    urgently confidential, as many different expert taste testers have deduced
    some of the ingredients inside the chicken, to the extent that if you
    combined all of their notes, you can get the full list, give or take a few.
    We will, however, take the server offline for the time being. 

This has gone from a one-off incident to a coincidence. If this happens again,
this is the true sign of something more meaningful than a list of herbs and
spices. As usual, I've left the Complete Herb and Spice List on the FTP server
(ftp.mht.com), so get it while it's still there!
