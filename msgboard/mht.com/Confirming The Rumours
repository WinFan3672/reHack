Yes, it's true. Nanosoft Workspaces 99 is coming later this year.
About 3 weeks ago, an anonymous leaker contacted us with some pre-release resources relating to Workspaces 99, which included a beta CD they sent to our address in London.
We reported on it and it quickly spread around. In fact, it's our largest article ever.

We couldn't verify the authenticity of the leaks, which we mentioned in the original article, but when a NanoSoft lawyer contacted me personally and asked me to take the article down, I was intrigued. I complied and asked to speak with someone about Workspaces 99. That request got denied.

However, less than 24 hours ago, I was invited to NanoSoft's annual conference. In this conference, the audience (including journalists) was given a demo of Workspaces 99.

Every single journalist was required to sign a trade embargo disallowing them from releasing information about this for another 2 weeks. Everyone except me. Why? No idea.
Spread this article before it gets taken down, I guess. I'll make a follow-up detailing all of Workspaces 99's new features soon. For now, let the air of suspense build tension and excitement.
