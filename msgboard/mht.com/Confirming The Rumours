Yes, it's true. Nanosoft Workspaces 8 is coming later this year. About 3 weeks
ago, an anonymous leaker contacted us with some pre-release resources relating
to Workspaces 8, which included a beta CD they sent to our address in London.
We reported on it and it quickly spread around. In fact, it's our largest
article ever.

We couldn't verify the authenticity of the leaks, which we mentioned in the
original article, but when a NanoSoft lawyer contacted me personally and asked
me to take the article down, I was intrigued. I complied and asked to speak
with someone about Workspaces 8. That request got denied.

However, less than 24 hours ago, I was invited to NanoSoft's annual conference.
In this conference, the audience (including journalists) was shown a live demo
of Workspaces 8.

Every single journalist was required to sign a trade embargo disallowing them
from releasing information about Workspaces 8, as NanoSoft estimates it won't
be ready for another few months. For whatever reason, I wasn't asked to sign a
trade embargo, but I'm sure I've pissed someone off already. Spread this
article before it gets taken down, I guess. I'll make a follow-up detailing all
of Workspaces 8's new features soon. For now, let the air of suspense build
tension and excitement.
