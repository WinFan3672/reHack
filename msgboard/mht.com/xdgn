Yesterday, RenWired launched, and I wrote my article about it. That article was
well-received, and I managed to create a media storm accross the entire news
spectrum. Everyone on both sides of the polticial spectrum, as well as both
technical and non-technical orgs were talking about it. In fact, I ended up
getting contacted by all manner of big 'journalists' like Fox News and whatnot
telling me that they were running my story and were asking for my permission. 

Anyway, I noticed this morning that RenWired have rebranded to xdg.net, and
have deleted their original announcement, which is a good sign. I'll be sure to
keep you all posted on updates on xdg.net, to see if my theory is true or not.
