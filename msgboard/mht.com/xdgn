Yesterday, Jacob Marksman registered the xdg.net domain name and launched the
spiritual successor to EnWired, which was a computer magazine and website that
ran from 1979 to 2008, when it was hit hard by the financial crisis ongoing at
the time.

Currently, there exists exactly one article, a first-impressions overlook of
the now three-year-old Workspaces 2007. The article also mentions that the
article in question was from the old EnWired archives, and the intentions were
to release it three years prior, but the company could not do so due to
bankruptcy proceedings.

So far, it doesn't look too hopeful, and it looks like xdg.net will disappear
as quickly as it comes. But maybe I'm wrong. I don't mind being corrected
there.
