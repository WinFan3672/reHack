Reports have come in that the brand-new online DCSE stock exchange is down for
maintenance. Millions of confused users are attempting to log in, and are
refused. Despite being down for less than a day, billions of dollars of trade
has slowed down to a crawl. An SFEC (the company that runs the DCSE)
representative has provied the following press statement:

    The DCSE is down today. We did not expect this, and all of our engineers
    have claimed that they never scheduled any maintenance and that all our
    systems were operational and would not need maintenance. This is clearly a
    targeted cyber-attack. It could be an attack from 5chan, the group of
    white supremacist anonymous collective that has been making cyber-strides
    lately. It could be a state actor from a myriad of foreign adversaries.
    It's either a very stupid prank or an attack on the great nation of
    America. Either way, the perpetrators must and will be caught and
    prosecuted.

    We will keep our systems down for 24 hours to aid with our investigation.

Safe to say, the message was a little patriotic, and more than a little
antagonistic and bombastic (particularly when it describes 5chan as a "white
supremacist" group), but it does prove without a doubt that someone is behind
it. If anything happens, watch your RSS feeds.
