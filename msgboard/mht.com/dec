Recently, the source code to DEC Suite (a popular encryption toolkit) was
leaked to the dark web and has been circulating around the Internet.

What Happened?

Earlier today, a post on VCFORUM (a popular hacking forum) included an
announcement that DEC Solutions had been hacked into. The post also included a
torrent file for the source code of DEC suite. Initially, the file was
downloaded by VCFORUM members, until the magnet link started being shared on
blogs and forums arond the world. Now, thousands have downloaded the source
code.

What Was Leaked?

- The source code to DEC Suite. 
    - This means that anyone can inspect the code for security issues, or
      compile their own version of DEC Suite.
- The signatures used to sign the compiled DEC Suite executables.
    - This means that anyone can pretend that their custom executable really
      came from DEC themselves.

What Now?

DEC Solutions provided a statement on their news website:
    We acknowledge that the leak has occured, and we will work with law
    enforcement to bring the hackers to justice. We will also work with
    cybersecurity pros to both perform damage control and release DEC Suite
    2.0, which will be much more secure, invalidating the leak for the most
    part. DEC 2.0 will be released in 2011.

    We have also worked with Nanosoft and our CA to reject our leaked digital
    signatures, meaning that you'll need to update DEC Suite to v1.1, which has
    a new signature.

As per usual, I have uploaded a copy of the source code to ftp.mht.com,
although that is largely pointless due to the torrent's popularity.
