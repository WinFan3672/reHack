Yesterday, I made an article about the Mountain View recipe being leaked. Well, since then, a lot has happened.
--------------------
MOUNTAIN VIEW GOT DISCONTINUED
--------------------
In an unsurprising press release, IsDed Corporation announced that they were
discontinuing Mountain View indefinitely, due to the recipe being leaked. All
flavours of the drink sold out withing an hour of the announcement going
public, and a New Coke-like panic started to reach teenagers across the United
States. In other countries, however, no such panic happened, because the drink
is much less popular there. A strange world we live in, isn't it.
--------------------
COCA CORPORATION MADE ANOTHER MOUNTAIN VIEW
--------------------
The first batches of "New Cirtus Blast" left the factory today, which is,
according to Coca Corp., 'a variation of Mountain View with less caffiene and
no flourine'. When asked about whether they were allowed to rip off their
competitor's product, they claimed that IsDed gave them the green light because
the product has been discontinued. It is 10% cheaper than the original Mountain
View, due to the lack of flourine, which should boost sales (and thus stock) by
quite a bit.
--------------------
ABOUT THE FLOURINE
--------------------
Due to the use of flourine in MV, a lot has happened:

1. A criminal investigation by the FDA has begun, and it is expected that
prosecution could start as soon as next week, due to the case being assigned
maximum priority.

2. A massive public outcry over the fact that food regulations did not catch
the flourine contamination has occured, and demand for greater transparency has
never been higher.

3. The US Supreme Court has launched a massive investigation into corruption in
the FDA, and claims that corruption is 'deep-rooted in the culture at the FDA',
and that court cases will move forward swiftly.

4. A massive recall has begun, with all bottles being collected in supermarkets
in exchange for the cash value of each bottle, that being $0.99. 

5. Multiple class-action lawsuits have begun, with 31 states starting their own
lawsuits for affected consumers in their region. The highest damages are
$500,000,000 each from the states of New York, Texas, and Maine.
--------------------
THE LEAKER WAS FOUND AND CAUGHT
--------------------
Thanks to a private tip-off to the police, an arrest was made this morning by
SEAL Team Six for one Noah Bailey, suspected to be the leaker of the recipe.
When under oath, he confessed to the crime, stating that he did it for
'altruistic reasons', and when asked to name his accomplices, he refused,
citing a non-disclosure agreement he had signed with his contractor. This has
lead to further suspicion, as NDAs are not an excuse for refusing to cooperate
with authorities. He will be questioned further, and if he provides names, he
might get a lighter sentence.
--------------------
CONCLUSION
--------------------
This has been a crazy finale to the Mountain View saga, and I don't intend to
make another article, unless a conviction is made, in which case I'll cover it
as I usually do.
