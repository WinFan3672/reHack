We will be removing `libdec` from our product in Debian 5.0.6, which will be releasing today. You can upgrade your OS very easily by following the instructions in the manual.
We have done this because we no longer believe DEC as a format is secure. Many different security vulnerabilities have been found, and we will not allow this in Debian.

We have moved libdec to the `nonfree` package repository, which is disabled by default but can be added through editing of a config file.
All programs that rely on DEC will need to update to add this dependency to the dependency list.

We will make sure that something like this doesn't happen in future.
