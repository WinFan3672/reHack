I've received some lovely emails from people who were sad about EnWired's death. Here are a few:

"I've been a subscriber of EnWired: The Magazine since '88 and I loved it. It's a great showcase of how rapidly technology evolved over time, and I guess EnWired has had its time and must pass, just like the early technology showcased back in the day."
- A reader from Miami.

"I would like to buy your company."
- Several private equity firms.

"I'm gonna go sell my magazines for a profit."
- A surprisingly large amount of people.

"Rest in peace, EnWired. Your thirty years of service will not be forgotten."
- A reader from the UK.

"I feel bad for all the writers. I hope they find a space for their amazing journalism, and I hope that EnWired is placed at the very top of their portfolio."
- A reader from Australia.

I've also seen a lot of articles being written by several news outlets:

"The death of EnWired is truly sad to see, but is an inevitability in an increasingly competitive space."
- MHT

"The saddest part is that their onionsite has gone down for good, replaced with a landing page."
- The Tor Times

You may be asking, what's next for me? The answer is retirement. I've been good friends with John Goodard, the founder of EnWired, since its founding, and he retired back in '98 to focus on his health once his time was up. I'm just glad he didn't make it to see EnWired go so soon. I guess now is my turn to retire.

"So long, and thanks for all the fish."
