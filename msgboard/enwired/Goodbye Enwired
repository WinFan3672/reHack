Due to financial struggles, I have made the tough decision to shut down EnWired's website. All previous articles (dating back to the 1970s) have been deleted from our website. However, individual articles can be purchased from us for a fee that allows us to keep operating to preserve decades of historical and important technology journalism.

COMMERCIAL LICENSE TERMS
You can use the article as many times as you want within the lifespan of the license. If licensing expires, you do not need to purchase another license to keep selling/distributing existing 
uses of the license, as that duration applies only to new uses of the article.

NON-COMMERCIAL LICENSE TERMS
You can do whatever you want with it, except pretend you made the article or make money off of it. Inclusion in part in a commercial work is fine, but must be < 20% of the article by page count.

PERSONAL LICENSE TERMS
You can request a free copy of an article (or buy the entire batch) for personal use, including research, leisure, education, or citation. If you wish to use it in any way other than for yourself, however, you will need to purchase a license.

To negotiate purchases of our articles, contact sales@enwired.mail and our sales rep will get back to you.
