Yes, it's true. No, the stories are not hyperbole. After my father retired and shut down the service, I decided to bring together the old EnWired writers, plus some new talent, and create RenWired. The name is temporary, and we'll establish a new identity soon. To clarify, my father has nothing to do with this, but he gave the project the green light. Expect more soon.
