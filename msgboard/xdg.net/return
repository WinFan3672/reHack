Yes, it's true. No, the stories are not hyperbole. After EnWired went bust and
my father retired, I decided to bring together the old writers, plus some new
talent, and create RenWired. The name is temporary, and we'll establish a new
identity soon. To clarify, my father has nothing to do with this, but he has
given the project the green light. Expect more soon.
