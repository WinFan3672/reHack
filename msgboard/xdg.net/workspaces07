The not-so-recent release of NanoSoft Workplace 2007 has led to a lot of
attention for the decades-old office suite. With major new UI and file format
changes, it's a major refresh that was much-needed, as the software was
getting quite stale.

New UI

All of the Workplace apps have been given a new "Ribbon" UI, which replaces
the traditional menu bar filled with options with a more visual and organised
interface, albeit one with less screen real estate.

The Ribbon UI element also comes with a new design motif: Live Preview. When
you hover over a ribbon option, you can see how that option affects you
document, allowing you to, for example, hover over every single column
option. The ribbon is also entirely customisable, meaning you can even add
your own tabs to it, if you wish. Imagine that!

New Document Format

The old file formats have been replaced with OpenOfficeXML (OOXML), which has
sparked controversy in the tech format. The new file formats are XML-based and
are arguably better than the older, binary formats, since it uses .ZIP for
compression, and is an open-source standard. For those who prefer it,
OpenDocument is also available.

Conclusion

This. Is. Cool. The release is very impressive, and the major UI refresh is a
welcome change that feels familiar yet futuristic. The new features are a
welcome inclusion, and I feel confident that the majority of people will be
impressed with this new release. In comparison, 2003 looks like it was
released in the early 2000s, and it feels just as functional.

Also, the removal of Workplace Assistant makes us *very* happy.
