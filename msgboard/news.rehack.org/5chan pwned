(23/May/2010) Someone on 5chan said some shit about reHack, so I decided to strike back. I broke into 5chan and found his IP. Using this, I ssh'd into his PC and left a RAT inside. Once the RAT ran, I managed to grab all of his creds, including his bank password. I withdrew all of his money into a money mule's bank account and blackmailed him into sending a further $20,000, leaving him in debt. Once he did that, I sent him all of his money back, because reHack'ers always have integrity.

NAME: JOEL R PAUL
DOB: November 4, 1986
IP ADDRESS: 44.167.1.254
For $150, I'll send you his fullz (CC info, address, SSN, passwords, etc).

Anyway, keep on reHack'ing, script kiddies. I'm out.
