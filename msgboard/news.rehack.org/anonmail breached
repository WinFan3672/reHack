(16/August/2023) Just a brief post to explain why AnonMail is down. I may or may not have tried to trace someone's IP address using it. I thought that *surely* they'd store SOME logs.
How wrong I was. Not only do they store LITERALLY nothing (the file system is practically empty), my activity was detected (so they have SOME logs) and I was thrown out of the network.
They're securing everything now.
