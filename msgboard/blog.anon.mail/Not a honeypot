(7 July 2010) The glowies recently came knocking on our doors asking about the information we had on a specific email account. We initially refused, but we had to comply. We handed over all of the information we had on this account:

* The IP address they used to sign up (this was a VPN IP address)
* Their IP address history
* The amount of messages they sent.

Turns out, this info was pretty much useless for them, and they quickly gave up. If you have good opsec (use a trustworthy VPN and don't brag to your friends), you can be reasonably assured that we're not giving up your info.
I doubt the FBI will be as confident next time.
