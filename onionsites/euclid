Euclid: Free Email For Tor
div()
The Onion Router (tor) is a decentralised network of anonymous websites with no associated IP addresses designed by the US navy (usa.gov). When the Tor email extension (RFC-TOR-EML_v1) was being proposed, the decision to only make emails sent in Tor only viewable from Tor was made. 

While it is possible to send clearnet emails from Tor using a basic proxy server, it is discouraged as clearnet email, unlike Tor email, is unencrypted. The Tor network's obfuscation of IP addresses through decentraliser, user-run nodes allows for mail servers to never know the true destination or recipient of an email beyond its email address and onion domain.

This is where Euclid comes in. Euclid is an email service running RFC-TOR-EML_v1 servers to provide an email address compatible with Tor. To sign up, go to `signup.euclid.onion`.
